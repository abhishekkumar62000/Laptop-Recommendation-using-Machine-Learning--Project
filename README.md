# Laptop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

🚀 **Project Overview**  
Today, I built a new project: **Laptop Recommendation Using Machine Learning**! This project leverages Python and various libraries to analyze laptop raw data and provide insightful recommendations.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language
- **Libraries**:
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
  - **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
  - **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization
  - **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: For implementing machine learning algorithms

## 📈 Project Highlights
- **Data Analysis**: Full analysis of laptop raw data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilized various algorithms to recommend the best laptops based on user preferences.
- **Visualization**: Created informative visualizations to represent the data and findings effectively.

## 🔍 Insights
